In a technology session led by one of TEL's General managers, Dr. Peter Loewenhardt, we discussed the remarkable growth of the semiconductor market expected in the next decade and the technological transformations underway. Peter highlighted key equipment technologies required for processes at the angstrom level and the changes in major semiconductor devices including #Logic, #DRAM, and 3D #NAND. 

‚óÜEnergy-Efficient Semiconductor Devices and Sustainability: #NetZero
Peter discussed critical challenges, including energy consumption and the need for innovation in semiconductor technology. In 2020-2021, the industry experienced a high growth rate of 26% annually, raising concerns about future energy usage. He indicated that by 2045, the industry could potentially consume all the world‚Äôs energy, highlighting the urgent need for more energy-efficient devices.

Students inquired about TEL's sustainability initiatives, learning that TEL aims to achieve net-zero for scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 2040. 
Peter emphasized the need for collaboration to tackle challenges while advancing technology. ü§ù

With the Episode‚Ñ¢ series of single-wafer deposition systems, #TokyoElectron addresses customer needs for device scaling, transitioning to 3D device structures, and diversifying film deposition materials. The products in this series are capable of handling complex deposition processes to achieve excellent productivity and environmental performance.

This article focuses on Episode‚Ñ¢ 2 DMR (Duo Matched Reactor), one of the products in the series. Built with a design concept that differs from its predecessors, Episode‚Ñ¢ 2 DMR combines a smaller tool footprint with high productivity, achieving a 25% reduction in CO2 emissions. Let us examine the development process of this system, its advanced design concept and features, and the TEL's development team responsible for its creation.
