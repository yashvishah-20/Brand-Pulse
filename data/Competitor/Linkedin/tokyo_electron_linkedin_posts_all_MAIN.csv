‚óÜNow is an Exciting Time for the Semiconductor Industry
In a technology session led by one of TEL's General managers, Dr. Peter Loewenhardt, we discussed the remarkable growth of the semiconductor market expected in the next decade and the technological transformations underway. Peter highlighted key equipment technologies required for processes at the angstrom level and the changes in major semiconductor devices including #Logic, #DRAM, and 3D #NAND. 

‚óÜEnergy-Efficient Semiconductor Devices and Sustainability: #NetZero
Peter discussed critical challenges, including energy consumption and the need for innovation in semiconductor technology. In 2020-2021, the industry experienced a high growth rate of 26% annually, raising concerns about future energy usage. He indicated that by 2045, the industry could potentially consume all the world‚Äôs energy, highlighting the urgent need for more energy-efficient devices.

Students inquired about TEL's sustainability initiatives, learning that TEL aims to achieve net-zero for scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 2040. 
Peter emphasized the need for collaboration to tackle challenges while advancing technology. ü§ù

2024-12-09 08:00:37,"With the advent of the AI era, the need to improve the performance and energy efficiency of semiconductor devices is more pressing than ever. As a result, 3D integration using permanent wafer bonding technology has become essential to the continued evolution of semiconductor devices. As a critical technology for high degrees of integration along with device scaling, permanent wafer bonding is increasingly in demand for the production of diverse semiconductor devices. 

These devices often require multiple bonding processes, making the technology hurdle even more challenging. Under these circumstances, the polishing and grinding steps to remove the unnecessary portion of silicon wafers requires a large amount of DI water during processing, and leads to reduced yield and a limitation on the number of available chips. Instead, an innovative technology is needed that contributes both to sustainability and productivity improvement.

Ulucus‚Ñ¢ LX is an innovative system designed to meet this need, featuring TEL‚Äôs Extreme Laser Lift Off technology and capable of performing laser beam irradiation, wafer removal, and wafer cleaning in a single unit. The system integrates TEL‚Äôs advanced laser control and wafer separation expertise.
